This is the documentation for the [Synthesizer.jl](https://github.com/femtomc/Synthesizer.jl) program synthesis system.

The goal of this package is to provide a set of interfaces for probabilistic program synthesis via sketching. The hope is to faciliate research into probabilistic program synthesis, as well as provide a pipeline to optimize synthesized programs as IR fragments, before compilation into a method body in Julia.
